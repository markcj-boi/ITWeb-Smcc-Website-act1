                <h2>SCHOOL'S HISTORY</h2>
                <p>In 1948, NASIPIT was still a part of the Parish of Buenavista, whose Parish Priest 
                    was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population 
                    also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry
                    of the Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr. Martin and his co-adjurer Fr. Atanacio
                    de Castro saw the need of putting-up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was made 
                    in charge of the school.
                    <br><br>
                    It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the 
                    first Director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr. Vicente 
                    Portillo, Rev. Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, and Rev. Fr. Anthony Krol in the order of 
                    succession. Rev. Fr. Krol was the last Dutch priest who served as the school director.
                    <br><br>
                    The school site is beside the rectory with an area of 1,630 sq.m. Fr. Gerard Cruisjen, 
                    one of the subsequent Directors converted the nipa-wooden structure into a concrete 
                    two-storey building with 16 classrooms.
                    <br><br>
                    When the Filipinization Law was implemented in 1975 a layman (now deceased) Mr. Gregorio Orias, 
                    became the first layman School Director until he retired in 1977. He was followed by 
                    Mr. Antonio L. Suarez, the first layman Director/Principal of the school. Faro Gatchalian 
                    followed until 1985 then Mrs. Necita Lim took the helm of the Directorship until 1991 while 
                    acting also as the Principal of St. James High School of Buenavista, an adjacent town of
                    Nasipit . In 1991, Fr. Achilles Ayaton became the School Director until 1993. In 1994, 
                    Msgr. Cesar L. Gatela took over the School's Directorship until 1999 when he succumbed to a 
                    cardiac arrest in Cebu City. In his term, he opened the Pre-School Department with Sister 
                    Minah B. Hijada as the Administrator and he bought 19 computers integrating the Computer 
                    Technology subject to all levels of the High School Department.
